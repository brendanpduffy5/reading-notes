# Class 6 Notes

## JavaScript Object Basics
*How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?*

I look at objects as a collection of related pieces of information or data.  I look at it as kinda a collection of collections.  For example it could be holding all the personal contact information of a student, a group of colors for a theme, or some functions that work together to complete a specific task.

*What are some advantages to creating object literals?*

Some advantages of creating object literals are flexibility in declaration, convenience, and less code is used in declaration.

*How do objects differ from arrays?*

Objects can be easier to work with since you can identify individual items by name and sending a single object is much more efficient.  Also objects tend to represent things with specific properties whereas arrays are short lists of data.

*Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.*

Bracket notation would be necessary when an object property name is held in a variable.

*Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?*

This is used to assign values to the object for the personally identifying information for dogs.  The advantage to using it is that we can sub in the multiple pieces of information at the same time for different dogs.

## Introduction To The DOM

*What is the DOM?*

DOM stands for Document Object Model and is a programing interface for web documents.  The DOM will represent the web page as nodes and objects allowing the programming languages to interact with the page.

*Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.*

The DOM a Web API that JavaScript uses to access and interact with the document and its elements.
