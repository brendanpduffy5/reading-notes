# Class 10 Notes

## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

*Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.*<br>
Syntax Errors are spelling errors in how we write the code.  Logic Errors are mistakes in what we are asking the code to do.<br>

*List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.*<br>

>+ I forgot a semicolon.  I fixed it by adding a semicolon.  This happened a lot the first week.
>+ I did not have enough brackets at 
>+ I was referring to a class from a CSS file and I called it section.three instead of section-three in the html file.  After proofreading I replaced the . with a -.  
>+ I used single quotes instead of tic marks when I was using a template literal.  That took me a while to figure out.

*How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?*<br>
	I think I am going to take the list for the previous question and make a mistakes journal / trouble shooting cheat sheet.  I totally messed up a template literal two weeks after the first time I did it and only caught it by accident.  It had just been enough time that I might have forgotten how to do it properly.  Given that I am if nothing else consistent, at least this will help me when I keep making the same mistakes down the road.
	Also, the reading emphasizing how logic errors are harder to deal with, I am going to put a little bit more planning into my preparation before I start actually writing the code so that I will be less likely to deal with any unintended consequences.

## The JavaScript Debugger.

*How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?*<br>
The JavaScript Debugger is a tool that a developer can use to watch the steps of their program run and it acts as a digital coach to help you identify which steps in the process aren’t working properly, as opposed to simply running the code, having it not work and then reading over all the different parts until the developer can see what is wrong.<br>

*Define what a breakpoint is.*<br>
A breakpoint is a step in the program where the developer creates an intentional pause in the program’s execution. <br>

*What is the call stack?*<br>
The call stack displays which pieces of code was already executed in order to get to the present line.<br>
