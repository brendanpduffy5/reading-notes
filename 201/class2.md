# Class 2 Notes: Readings: Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

These topics are important because they are the foundational structures for websites and we need to fully understand them before we can move on to building apps that interact with other larger systems.

## Introduction to HTML, HTML Text Fundamentals. HTML Advanced Text Formatting.

*Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?*

*How many levels of headings are there in HTML?*

    All my kids' afterschool activities start between 4:00pm - 6:15pm but I sometimes shift.  I finally figure it out and then something changes.  I really need a better Calendar fuction app that tells me which kid goes where on which day!

### Making Decisions In Your Code - Conditionals

*An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.*
    Condition, True

*What is the use of an else if?*
    An else if tests for a new second condition if the first condition is false.

*List 3 different types of comparison operators.*
    >= means greater than or equal to
    <= means less than or equal to
    === compares strict equality

*What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?*

    && "AND" can evaluate two or more expressions that all need to be true in order to return true

    || "OR" can evaluate two or more expressions, where if one of them is true the whole expression returns true.
