# Class 7 Notes

## Domain Modeling
*Explain why we need domain modeling.*

Domain modeling helps developers to design their code in a more intentional and focused way that saves time in the long run and increases efficiency.  By making a abstract model for the particular problem at hand, helps the developer better understand the problem itself and in the end write better code.

## HTML Table Basics
*Why should tables not be used for page layouts?*

Tables in page layouts are bad for the following reasons:
  >+ Tables in layouts can reduce the accessibility function of the page for any visually impaired page visitors.
  >+ Tables end up with a lot of tags and much more complex and potentially messy code.
  >+ Tables are not automatically responsive and extra steps are needed to make them work properly across devices.

*List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML \<table>.*
  
  >+ \<th> = table header
  >+ \<col> = columns
  >+ \<colgroup> = column group

## Introducing Constructors
  
*What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?*
  
A constructor is a function that is called using the new keyword.  Some advantages are that it can create a new object, return the new object, and run the code in the constructor.
  
*How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?*
  
It will bind this to the newly created object, so that the developer can refer to this in the constructor code.
  
## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor
  
*Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question*
  
When I worked in insurance sales, there were templates and forms for various types of coverages.  We could look at those as the prototypes.  Depending on the needs of the customer and their assets, we could load and arrange various levels of coverages and premiums and we could look at those inheritances that pull down and use when necessary.
