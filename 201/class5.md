# Class 5 Notes

## HTML Media
### Using Images In HTML. Read Common Image Types and Choosing Image Formats.

*What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?*
Alt attributes help visually impaired users find out about what the image is via a screen reader.

*How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?*
use alt attributes that give an accurate but not lengthy description of the image.

*Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.*
To cleary link a caption to an image.

*Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.*
A gif is made to be a certain size so it will be blurry if you enlarge it too much but an svg image can be scaled up in size like films using a projector.

*What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?*
Lossless Webp because it will give the clearest resolution.

## Learn CSS
### Using Color in CSS. Styling HTML Text Elements

*Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.*
Foreground colors are the color of the text and text decorations like underlines.  Background colors would be the color of the page or screen that the words are written on.

*Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?*
I would make sure that the contrast between the text and the background was sharp enough that you could easily see the difference but not obnoxiously clashing.  I would also ask them about the message and brand of the website and their intentions into account when putting the website together.

*What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?*
Make sure that the type of font is easy to read and also is compatable with the mood and message of the content.  For example, you would use a different font for a funeral annoucement than you would for an invitation to a child's birthday party.

*What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?*
Font-size adjusts the length and size of the characters.
Font-weight adjusts how bold the font is.
Font-style can make it normal, italic, or oblique.

*Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.*
I could use text-align: center or word-spacing.
