# Class 13 Notes
## Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

*Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?*<br>
Local storage allows for more data to be stored and retrieve inside of the user’s browser, making for a better user experience. <br>

*What information should not be stored in local storage?* <br>
Personally Identifiable Information, user’s location, passwords, authentication tokens, and API keys should not be stored in local storage. <br>

*Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?* <br>
Local storage can only store strings data types.  Using the methods JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() are ways that the developer can deal with that limitation. <br>
