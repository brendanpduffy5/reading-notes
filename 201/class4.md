# Class 4 Notes

## Learn HTML

### Creating Hyperlinks

*1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?*
an \<a> element 

*2. The href attribute contains what information?*
the url

*3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?*
We can include the title attribute in the \<a> element to help screen readers identify them.


## CSS Layout

### CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

*1. What is meant by “normal flow”?*
Normal flow is the default layout for CSS elements and means how elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout.

*2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?*
Inline elements never start from a new line and only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the html element. Whereas, block-level elements always start from a new line and cover space from the left to the right as far as it can go.

*3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.*
Static positioning

*4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.*
Since the absolute positioned element is on it's own layer, developers can create isolate UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements.  Also the positioning of the element is the distance of the element from the containing element's side.

*5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?*
Fixed positioning is not affected by scrolling and only references the browser window.  Absolute is removed from the normal layout.

## Learn JS

### Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code

*Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.* Function declaration is creating a function.  Function invocation is the process of executing the function.


*What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?* A parameter is a vaariable in a function.  An argument is the data that gets passed into the parameters.

## Miscellaneous

*Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.*
Greater efficiency and Social skills are the two biggest reasons that jump out at me the most right now.  My dad always told me that two heads are better than one and to work as a team if you can.  It makes sense that having two programmers double checking each other's work will help save time by reducing mistakes.  The practice of social skills is also a great use.  Coding can be really frustrating, so practicing how to deal with people in this specific circumstance could definitely help people be more successful when doing pair programming down the road in our careers.
