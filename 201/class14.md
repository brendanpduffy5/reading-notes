## CSS Transforms

*What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?*<br>
Transform allows the developer to move an element by rotating, scaling, skewing or translating it.  Elements can be transformed on the x and y axes in a two-dimensional way or in a three-dimensional way on the x, y, and z axes.<br>

*Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.* <br>
An example of a transform element on a website could be if you wanted to make a card game on a website.  You could use transform: translate to flip the card image over in a way that would visually look like flipping over a playing card.<br>

## CSS Transitions & Animations

*What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?* <br>
A developer can change the appearance or behavior of an element when a state change happens.<br>
*How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?* <br>
Transitions are good at single state changes but would need to have multiple states change to make a moving picture whereas animations can exercise more control over the more complex situation of moving pictures. <br>

## Psychological Safety

*What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?*
>+ Everyone gets to speak approximately the same amount.
>+ People on the team are socially aware of how the other people in the group were feeling based on their non-verbal cues.
>+ People on the team believe that they will not be embarrassed, rejected, or punished for speaking up.

*Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.*<br>
On my first deployment, we had an assistant manager added to our team after we had already been together for six months.  Mr. G was a more traditionalist type of personality and we were working at an embassy in a very non-traditional role.  He was excessively controlling and distrustful of all of the team members and thought it was his role to double check everything.  Any idea that was not black and white from a manual was shouted down as wrong and illegal.  As a result, projects backed up at the bottle neck he created and team morale plummeted.  Within a month, the other members of my team had started contributing the bare minimum.  My workout buddy was no longer going in to the embassy with me early in the morning to exercise because he just couldn’t stand riding in a car with Mr. G.  Our ability to work within the interagency community was hindered to the point that Mr. G was reassigned to another task force within three months.  We were able to continue and become successful, but the damage to our community’s reputation was long standing.<br>

*What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?*
>+ Team members feel free to challenge ideas and propose better solutions
>+ Team members admit mistakes more readily allowing for problems to get solved faster and for them to learn more
>+ Teams like this report a higher level of job satisfaction and team members have more buy in so they feel that the success of the team is also their own success.
