# Class 06 Reading Notes

## How I explained REST to my brother
1.	*Who is Roy Fielding?*<br>
He is a computer scientist that helped to write the first web servers and then did research on how the web works. <br>
2.	*Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?* <br>
Because back then the primary concern was being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world, whereas later developers had different priorities and only needed to talk to a small group of machines. <br>
3.	*What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?* <br>
The HTTP that they created works by applying the same universal verbs to different nouns in the program. <br>
4.	*What does a GET do?* <br>
GET imports or retrieves a resource for the program.
5.	*What does a POST do?* <br>
POST allows one system to add something to another system.	 
6.	*What does PUT do?* <br>
PUT allows a system to replace something in another system. <br>
7.	*What does PATCH do?* <br>
PATCH allows a system to do a partial update in another system. <br>
