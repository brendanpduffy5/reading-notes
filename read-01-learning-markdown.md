# Notes for Read: 01 - Learning Markdown

- GitHub is a place where we can store and share projects and documentation with friends, coworkers or potential employers.

- GitHub’s Jekyll is an open source tool that enables you to change plain text into static websites and blogs that can be personalized.

- Markdown is good for quick easy to read notes but it does have some limitations.

- html is needed to be used I you want multiple line breaks.

- I don’t need to memorize everything, just know where to find it if I need help.

- With unordered lists, I need to stay consistent and use the same syntax (* or -) within the list.

  - nested lists are an option for indented sub lists.
  
- to include links:

> `[Page Name](https://urlname.com/)`

- Images can be supported in markdown.  You can display an image from your repository.
