# My Reading Journal for 102

Hello, my name is Brendan and this is my reading notes journal for Code Fellows 102.

## What is the Growth Mindset?
The growth mindset is a way of looking at obstacles or sometimes even difficult life events as a way to help you grow into a better version of yourself instead of looking at them as something that is inherently bad.  Everyone runs into challenges, obstacles or simply bad things in their life but it is how we choose to perceive and approach those things that determines whether or not we are successful.  

## Experience helps.
My son is a perfectionist and has a really hard time when he does something wrong.  The good news is I don't often have to correct him as he usually realizes his mistakes.  The bad news is that he is way harder on himself than my wife or I ever would be.  I have tried various ways of explaining that life doesn't always go the way we planned and helping him understand a growth mindset, but for a long time he got hung up on what he **"should"** have done.  One thing that I finally got to resonate with him was the following quote, 

*"Good decisions come from experience and often experience comes from making bad decisions."*  

Now, thankfully he didn't take this as a free pass to do a bad thing once and get away with it, but it clicked for him.  He started seeing life more like a video game where he is building up experience points before he goes on the big quest and that it's ok that he doesn't always master something right away.  He's building towards something bigger.  I need to remember this while studying.


## Just get started.
I learn a lot from my wife.  After several years off, my wife is trying to get back into running.  Next week, she will compete in a 5K for the first time in a few years.  We were talking and she said that she is not worried about her pace or mileage or all the other preconceived notions she's worried about in the past.  Right now, she's just worried about getting out the door because she knows that if she can at least do that, she'll get some kind of a workout in and be closer to her goal.  After hearing her explain that, I realized that I have my own constraints that hold me back and that sometimes I will avoid studying coding because there are too many "what ifs" that could go wrong.  I realized that even if I don't do it perfectly, I'm still learning how not to do it or reading about concepts that can partially sink in.  So I stopped focusing on specific obstacles and try to just block off an hour of time where I can study anything and let obstacles come as they may.  Even if I don't get something to work, I'm still learning.


## Win or learn.
I've studied jiu jitsu for years and now my kids are enjoying it.  There is one expression that is always repeated in the community: 

*"You either win or you learn."*

When the kids are grappling with other kids, they don't always win and that can be difficult sometimes- especially when my kids get really competitive.  Luckily they all understand that even if they do not win, they are being shown different moves and strategies throughout the process.  So now when someone beats one of them, I don’t see a sore loser, but an excited interested kid who immediately says, **“Cool!  How did you do that?”**

## So, to remind myself to keep a Growth Mindset, remember:
- Experience helps
- Just get started
- Win or learn
