## Terminal

Terminal is the command center.
The same commands work in Linux, macOS, and Windows.  However, PowerShell has some of its own commands and language.
A directory is a folder.
Think of text editors like a notepad with spell check for coding.  Pick one that works for your languages and preferences.  Text editors can be customized for ease of use and upgraded with extensions.

## Commands

+ *Pwd* – print working directory, aka where am I right now in the terminal?
+ *Ls* – list contents in the directory that I am at
+ *“Ls -a”* (ls space dash a) = “list all” will show hidden files
+ *Clear* - cleans up terminal
+ *Mkdir* – make directory (sometimes called McDur) so “mkdir my-demo-folder” would make a folder “my-demo-folder”
+ *Cd* – change directory, “cd folder-name” will take to me the directory called “folder-name”

+ *Touch* – will create a new file.  You must tell the terminal what type of file you want it to be
