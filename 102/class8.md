# Class 8 Notes

*Expression* - a valid unit of code that resolves to a value
two types of expressions:
>+some have side effects (such as assigning values) for example x = 5
>+some purely evaluate 5 + 2

*assignment operator* - assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.

*comparison operator* - compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.

*for loop (aka for statement)* - repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

>for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement

*while statement* executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.

>while (condition)
  statement
