# Class 7 Notes

## Programming with JavaScript

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script, from the top line down to the bottom line (unless the computer is directed otherwise).
In JS, a function will execute until it reaches a return statement (or breaks).  If the function was invoked by a statement, JS will “return” to execute the code after the invoking statement.

Functions allow you to define what you want done in the code once and then use it many times.
Local variables are defined within a function (are LOCAL to it) and can only be used or accessed within that specific function.
