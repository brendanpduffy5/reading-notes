# Class 4 Notes

## Structure Web Pages with HTML

Wireframing is an easy way to mock up a website and test the basic design and user experience before investing time and energy into coding.  There are different steps and ways to wireframe and plan depending on the scope and depth of the project.  Wireframing can be sketch on paper, a whiteboard, or on specialized software.
Do research ahead of time and take time to properly figure out the user flow- it will save you time in the long run.  Overall simpler planning makes for easier development.

### 6 Steps to make a wireframe

1. Do your research
2. Prepare your research for reference
3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
5. Add some detail and get testing
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

### Three key principles for a good wireframe

1. Maintain clarity
2. Gain user confidence
3. Simplicity is key

## Notes on HTML

+ html provides structure for the content of the page.
+ Attributes are extra informational notes you can leave in the code.  Attributes need to go into the opening tag.
+ Semantic tags refer to the meaning of the tag.
opening tag + content + closing tag = html element

+ Attributes that set a value need to have the following:

    >+ A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
    >+ The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
    >+ The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.

+ Self-closing tags don’t need to be closed with second tag.  Image is an example.
+ Elements that have no content are called void elements.
+ Putting elements inside of other elements is called nesting.
+ The *https://* or *http://* part at the beginning of the web address is called the *protocol*.
