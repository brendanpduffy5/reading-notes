# Class 5 Notes

## Design web pages with CSS

HTML is get stuff on the page and make it work while CSS is making it look pretty.  HTML is the structure, CSS is the style.  We can use CSS to change how html is presented, like changing the color or size of the content.  CSS can also be used for creating a specific layout or animation.

CSS is broken down into modules.  
Designers can assign different colors for Backgrounds and Borders.
CSS specifications  and standards are maintained by the CSS Working Group.
CSS can help to break a page down into columns.  Flexbox can used for single rows or columns of items.
Using an external style sheet, we can modify the look of an entire website by changing just one file.  In order to do that, the HTML page needs to include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the element, inside the head section.

## CSS terms

h1 {color: red;}
selector – refers to an element of HTML to style
declarations – a rule we make like  
property – like a variable (color in the example above)
value – what we decide the property will be (red in the example above)
